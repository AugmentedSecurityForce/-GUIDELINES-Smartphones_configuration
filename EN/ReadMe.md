# SUBJECT
The purpose of this article is to list the actions to be taken upon receiving your smartphone, whether it's an Android or an iPhone.

_You may notice that one OS has more recommendations than the other; this does not mean that one OS is better, but simply that I am more familiar with it._

## PROFESSIONAL CONTEXT
There are likely many more rules (especially in a professional context), but the goal here is to keep a functional phone while minimizing security risks.

It is important to review all available settings on each OS and version to ensure the highest level of security.

# UPDATE (ANDROID / IPHONE)
The first action is to update your device as soon as you receive it.
It is preferable to have an up-to-date device before installing or importing your data. Besides the security provided by an up-to-date device, updates may introduce new settings or reset certain configurations.

# ENABLE SCREEN LOCK WITH A PASSCODE / PATTERN / FINGERPRINT (ANDROID / IPHONE)
The goal of this lock is to ensure that no one can physically use your smartphone.
_In addition, on Android, this enables device encryption._

* The lock must be activated immediately after the phone goes to sleep (by pressing the button).
* The lock must be activated within a very short period of inactivity, i.e., less than a minute.
* Unlocking the phone will require entering a code (consisting only of digits), a pattern (3x3), or your fingerprint.

## WHICH PROTECTION TO CHOOSE?
* The PIN code should be long (more than 4 characters) and complex (avoid birthdays, numerical sequences like 1234, etc.) to offer adequate resistance.
* The pattern seems to be a good compromise, although, unfortunately, similar patterns are often used (like the pyramid, snail, "L"). However, it has the advantage of better resistance to social engineering.
* Fingerprint recognition seems to be, in my opinion, the most secure solution. It is unique, and although there are ways to create "copies" under normal circumstances, it is unlikely that you would be subjected to this type of attack.

## MAXIMUM NUMBER OF TRIES
Unless there are specific reasons, there is no need to make 5, 10, or 30 mistakes with the unlock code.
There are several protections, such as:
* Factory reset of the device.
* Destruction of encryption keys.
* Increasing the delay before attempting a new code.

# ENABLE ENCRYPTED BACKUP (ANDROID / IPHONE)
Your phone is secure, and it's essential that your backups are too.
Data securely stored on your device can be easily accessed from a local backup on a computer. Forcing backup encryption protects your data from compromise in case your computer or backup space is compromised.

# DISPLAY A MESSAGE ON THE LOCK SCREEN (ANDROID / IPHONE)
The idea is to display a contact, an address, a name, etc., so that if you lose your phone, the person who finds it can contact you.

In a professional context, it is advisable to prioritize the phone number or email address of the phone's standard or IT department.

# ENSURE DEVELOPER MODE IS DISABLED (ANDROID / IPHONE)
It is quite simple to understand that this mode allows for the modification of system settings that have no place for a regular user.

# DISALLOW INSTALLATION OF UNKNOWN APPS (ANDROID)
On Android, there are several app stores. Each manages the security of the apps it offers in its own way.
While the Google Play Store may contain vulnerable apps, it is wise to use it as the only authorized app store.

# DO NOT ROOT THE PHONE (ANDROID / IPHONE)
Rooting (Android) or jailbreaking (iPhone) can expose your device to increased security risks. Full access to the operating system can allow malware or hackers to exploit vulnerabilities, compromising the security of your phone and personal

 data.

_For those who think "it's nothing," are you sure that all the photos on your phone can be made public? That all your SMS/MMS can be made public?_

# USE NETWORK-PROVIDED TIME (ANDROID / IPHONE)
Forcing the use of your provider's time servers ensures that the time is synchronized across all devices, takes into account time zone differences, etc.

# ENABLE REMOTE LOCATION OF THE PHONE (ANDROID / IPHONE)
This allows you to geolocate your device in case of loss or theft.
Please note that some people may feel monitored by this setting.

iPhone: [Link](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT210400)

# ENABLE REMOTE LOCK AND ERASE (ANDROID / IPHONE)
In addition to the previous point, this allows you to lock the phone and, most importantly, erase the data it contains.

# ENABLE GOOGLE SCAN ON THE PHONE (ANDROID)
This setting allows Google to periodically scan your smartphone for security issues, such as apps removed from the app store due to being malicious.

# DISABLE WI-FI ASSISTANT (ANDROID)
This feature connects to open Wi-Fi networks and redirects your network traffic to Google's servers.
In a personal or professional context, you should only use open Wi-Fi networks with a VPN connection that you consider trustworthy.

Android: [Link](https://support.google.com/android/answer/6188557?hl=en)

# DISABLE / REMOVE USER ADDITION FROM THE LOCK SCREEN (ANDROID)
Each user has their storage space, theoretically accessible only to them.
However, there is a guest account that can install apps or change settings, which could compromise your phone's security.

Android: [Link](https://cleanbrowsing.org/help/docs/disable-access-to-guest-mode-on-android/)

# DISABLE INSTANT APPS (ANDROID)
Instant apps allow you to use an app without installing it on the device. By clicking on an app link, the browser downloads and runs the app's module.
This technology poses risks, as a malicious link could be used to deceive the user. Furthermore, this feature generally contradicts security policies and enterprise security devices that rely on authorizing or refusing apps at the time of installation. Therefore, it is recommended to disable instant apps.

# DISABLE BLUETOOTH
If you do not use Bluetooth, it is recommended to completely disable it.

# DO NOT USE KEYBOARD APPS
Not surprisingly, there are several apps that allow you to modify the default keyboard. Unfortunately, each of these apps can have vulnerabilities or be designed specifically to extract the data you enter.

# DO NOT DISPLAY NOTIFICATIONS ON THE LOCK SCREEN (ANDROID/IPHONE)
The goal is to be able to leave your phone on a table without the content of notifications being readable by anyone.
If a message requires unlocking the phone, it is reasonable to consider that the same level of security is required to read the notification.

# DISABLE SIRI WHEN THE PHONE IS LOCKED (IPHONE)
Siri is specific to iPhones. Using it when the phone is locked can, for example, allow making calls by impersonating the owner's identity.
In general, using Siri on a locked device can allow unauthorized users to access information that would normally be unavailable to them, such as messages, contacts, and various other data.

# DISABLE CONTROL CENTER FROM THE LOCK SCREEN (IPHONE)
The Control Center allows, among other things, to enable airplane mode. Making it available from the lock screen allows a thief to activate airplane mode to avoid device tracking.

# ENABLE FRAUD PROTECTION (IPHONE)
Safari is capable of warning the user when a website is known to be malicious.
Enabling this feature helps protect you.
